    4.6. Rights
    Note that the LOM-defined cost and copyright_and_other_restrictions fields are highly problematic, and that a more detailed rights description language is necessary to adequately express the often complex rights issues surrounding resource creation and reuse. However, the vast majority of application profiles mandate the rights category, and it is therefore recommended for use within this application profile.
